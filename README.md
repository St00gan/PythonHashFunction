# PythonHashFunction
I created this repo in order to share the short project I worked on which was creating a simple Hash Function in python.
I have commented on (close to) every line in this code in order to help begginers better understand what I have done and what each line of the code means. **THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE PROJECT**. I have not done anything in the entropy definition as shown in the code. Feel free to put your own code in there to further complicate the hash at more advanced levels.
# How to use
Set the value in bit.txt to the desired length of your string
Run the python file and type in your string in or copy it from the internet
Let it find your hash (this won't be that secure without putting stuff in entropy())
# What I plan to do
- add a compiled version of the python file
- add a pre-made version of entropy()
- add a salting function
- commit die because I wrote code in python
